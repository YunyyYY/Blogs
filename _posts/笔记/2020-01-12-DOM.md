### What is DOM

Document Object Model: programming interface for HTML and XML documents.

The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:

>  "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

- Core DOM - standard model for all document types
- XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
- HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents
